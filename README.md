# RayTracerV1
A Simple SDL Raytracer made in C++

# To make it go
* Just run make
* You need an xwindow environment or the like
* The program was tested using `vcxsrv` from within WSL
* Should just run natively on Linux with SDL2 installed

# Instructions
* Use `main.cpp` to create spheres and mess with lighting, an example is in place


# What is it
* This is a ray tracer built from scratch using the SDL API to *only* place pixels individually, everything else is hand made by me

# Features
* Sphere rendering
* Specularity
* Shadows
* Reflections

# Example

* Here is a simple scene.
